# React Redux Task
I get JSON data and create a cart page with per item price , per item quantity,
Total quantity and total amount using useSelector and useDispatch reactredux hooks.

useSelector: allows access to the state stored in a Redux store.

useDispatch: allows functional components to dispatch actions to the Redux store.

In this task we can increase the quantity and decrease the quantity,see the remaining stocks available.

Next we see the totalquantity and totalprice and how much quantity we added.
